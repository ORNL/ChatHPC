      abstract = {ChatHPC democratizes large language models for the high-performance computing (HPC) community by providing the infrastructure, ecosystem, and knowledge needed to apply modern generative AI technologies to rapidly create specific capabilities for critical HPC components while using relatively modest computational resources. Our divide-and-conquer approach focuses on creating a collection of reliable, highly specialized, and optimized AI assistants for HPC based on the cost-effective and fast Code Llama fine-tuning processes and expert supervision. We target major components of the HPC software stack, including programming models, runtimes, I/O, tooling, and math libraries. Thanks to AI, ChatHPC provides a more productive HPC ecosystem by boosting important tasks related to portability, parallelization, optimization, scalability, and instrumentation, among others. With relatively small datasets (on the order of KB), the AI assistants, which are created in a few minutes by using one node with two NVIDIA H100 GPUs and the ChatHPC library, can create new capabilities with Meta’s 7-billion parameter Code Llama base model to produce high-quality software with a level of trustworthiness of up to 90\% higher than the 1.8-trillion parameter OpenAI ChatGPT-4o model for critical programming tasks in the HPC software stack.},

      abstract = {The Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard plays a crucial role in enabling scientific applications for parallel computing and is an essential component in high-performance computing (HPC). However, implementing MPI code manually—especially applying a proper domain decomposition and communication pattern—is a challenging and error-prone task. We present ChatMPI, an AI assistant for MPI parallelization of sequential C codes. In our analysis, we focus on testing six essential HPC workloads, which are based on Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms levels 1, 2, and 3 as well as sparse, stencil, and iterative operations. We analyze the process of creating ChatMPI by using the ChatHPC library. This lightweight large language model (LLM)–based infrastructure enables HPC experts to efficiently create and supervise trustworthy AI capabilities for critical HPC software tasks. We study the data required for training (fine-tuning) ChatMPI to generate parallel codes that not only use MPI syntax correctly but also apply HPC techniques to reduce memory communication and maximize performance by using proper work decomposition. With a relatively small training dataset composed of a few dozen prompts and fewer than 15 minutes of fine-tuning on one node equipped with two NVIDIA H100 GPUs, ChatMPI elevates trustworthiness for MPI code generation of current LLMs (e.g., Code Llama, ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT 5). Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the MPI codes generated by ChatMPI in comparison with the ones generated by ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-5. The codes generated by ChatMPI provide up to a 4 \texttimes{} boost in performance by using better problem decomposition, communication patterns, and HPC techniques (e.g., communication avoiding).},

In this study, LLMs are used to translate 11 different parallel Fortran codes with some of the most popular and widely used kernels/proxies in high-performance computing (HPC): AXPY, GEMV, GEMM, Jacobi, SpMV, and the >200-line Hartree-Fock application proxy, which implements a solver for quantum many-body systems. In all, we analyze the correctness and reproducibility of more than 1,650 AI-generated parallel C/C++ codes. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of Fortran codes and AI-generated C/C++ codes on two modern HPC architectures—one AMD EPYC Rome CPU with 64 cores and one NVIDIA Ampere A100 GPU. We use multi-modal prompting and fine-tuning techniques for LLMs to produce parallel scientific C/C++ codes with high levels of correctness (more than 95% of the codes are well ported) and speedups of up to an order of magnitude versus Fortran + OpenMP and Fortran + OpenACC codes on the same system.},

This work enhances the capabilities of code LLMs in CUDA-to-SYCL kernel translation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The resultant fine-tuned LLM, called ChatPORT, is an effort to provide high-fidelity translations from one programming model to another. We describe the preparation of datasets from heterogeneous computing benchmarks for model fine-tuning and testing, the parameter-efficient fine-tuning of 19 open-source code models ranging in size from 0.5 to 34 billion parameters and evaluate the correctness rates of the SYCL kernels by the fine-tuned models. The experimental results show that most code models fail to translate CUDA codes to SYCL correctly. However, fine-tuning these models using a small set of CUDA and SYCL kernels can enhance the capabilities of these models in kernel translation. Depending on the sizes of the models, the correctness rate ranges from 19.9\% to 81.7\% for a test dataset of 62 CUDA kernels.},

      abstract = {Abstract We apply AI-assisted large language model (LLM) capabilities of GPT-3 targeting high-performance computing (HPC) kernels for (i) code generation, and (ii) auto-parallelization of serial code in C ++, Fortran, Python and Julia. Our scope includes the following fundamental numerical kernels: AXPY, GEMV, GEMM, SpMV, Jacobi Stencil, and CG, and language/programming models: (1) C++ (e.g., OpenMP [including offload], OpenACC, Kokkos, SyCL, CUDA, and HIP), (2) Fortran (e.g., OpenMP [including offload] and OpenACC), (3) Python (e.g., numpy, Numba, cuPy, and pyCUDA), and (4) Julia (e.g., Threads, CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl, and KernelAbstractions.jl). Kernel implementations are generated using GitHub Copilot capabilities powered by the GPT-based OpenAI Codex available in Visual Studio Code given simple <kernel> + <programming model> + <optional hints> prompt variants. To quantify and compare the generated results, we propose a proficiency metric around the initial 10 suggestions given for each prompt. For auto-parallelization, we use ChatGPT interactively giving simple prompts as in a dialogue with another human including simple “prompt engineering” follow ups. Results suggest that correct outputs for C++ correlate with the adoption and maturity of programming models. For example, OpenMP and CUDA score really high, whereas HIP is still lacking. We found that prompts from either a targeted language such as Fortran or the more general-purpose Python can benefit from adding language keywords, while Julia prompts perform acceptably well for its Threads and CUDA.jl programming models. We expect to provide an initial quantifiable point of reference for code generation in each programming model using a state-of-the-art LLM. Overall, understanding the convergence of LLMs, AI, and HPC is crucial due to its rapidly evolving nature and how it is redefining human-computer interactions.},

Our goal is to compare the accuracy of Llama-2 and our original GPT-3 baseline by using a similar metric. Llama-2 has a simplified model that shows competitive or even superior accuracy. We also report on the differences between these foundational large language models as generative AI continues to redefine human-computer interactions. Overall, Copilot generates codes that are more reliable but less optimized, whereas codes generated by Llama-2 are less reliable but more optimized when correct.",

We use the GitHub Copilot capabilities powered by the GPT-based OpenAI Codex available in Visual Studio Code as of April 2023 to generate a vast amount of implementations given simple <kernel> + <programming model> + <optional hints> prompt variants. To quantify and compare the results, we propose a proficiency metric around the initial 10 suggestions given for each prompt. Results suggest that the OpenAI Codex outputs for C++ correlate with the adoption and maturity of programming models. For example, OpenMP and CUDA score really high, whereas HIP is still lacking. We found that prompts from either a targeted language such as Fortran or the more general-purpose Python can benefit from adding code keywords, while Julia prompts perform acceptably well for its mature programming models (e.g., Threads and CUDA.jl). We expect for these benchmarks to provide a point of reference for each programming model’s community. Overall, understanding the convergence of large language models, AI, and HPC is crucial due to its rapidly evolving nature and how it is redefining human-computer interactions.},
